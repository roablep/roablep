### Hi, I'm Peter.
I'm an inquisitive guy with varied interests. 

My professional expertise spans systems thinking and organizational design; ad tech and quantitative marketing; and classical ML, NLP, LLMs and Gen AI. 

I'm passionate about Burning Man, PLUR rave culture, and urban planning. 

I have a well-trained dog and several bicycles.

I can be neurotic and will pull on a thread for longer than I probably should.

This year Iâ€™m challenging myself to explore my creativity.

I live in New York City with Spencer and Brian. One walks on two legs, the other on four. 

I try to pay it forward; feel free to reach out.
