### Hi, I'm Peter.

<img src="peter.jpeg?raw=true" width="400">

I'm an inquisitive guy with varied interests. I try not to take myself too seriously, as you should learn from the photo. (If you need a professional headshot, go [here](7D1A8939.jpg?raw=true).)

#### My Work
- I was trained in financial analysis and have spent the last 12 years working in product. I’ve worked at startups, growth-stage companies and enterprises. 
- I've developed expertise in systems thinking and organizational design; ad tech and quantitative marketing; and "AI" including both classical ML and NLP techniques from the 2010s as well as contemporary approaches that use LLMs. Although admitting an interest in AI feels about as groundbreaking as confessing that I rely on water to survive.
- I'm motivated by team building, navigating complex organizations, and finding product-market fit in unlikely places.

#### Track Record

I've experienced the spectrum of bootstrapped startup failures to enterprise successes. My professional bets _tend_ to be more often right than wrong:

- Experienced failure as a bootstrapped founder. Lessons learned a-plenty. 
- Experienced success as a product executive  at a F50 company. Succeeded in a high risk bet - launching a completely new product suite in a completely new market - by co-developing with a pilot customer. Importantly, solved internal cross functional alignment challenges typical of large matrix organizations _without being a jerk_. 
- Experienced success as an early stage (seed/series A) product VP. Scaled a product-Eng team from 3 contractors to 15 full time folks, establishing norms for product operations, team development and psychology safety. The team liked the mission, the challenge, and the work. 
- Experienced success as a mid-level product manager at a legacy media company undergoing digital transformation. Launched a series of media products that provided directly attributable revenue, helping notoriously independent brands and commission-based ad sellers meaningfully grow their businesses without overly harming the consumer experience.
- Experienced success as an IC PM at a growth stage startup. Hacked with engineers and policy teams to create ways to improve trust  in a digital advertising marketplace. Most proud of our highly technical and nerdy early ML that detected ad fraud, illicit content, and malware. 


#### Everything Else

- I'm passionate about Burning Man, PLUR rave culture, and urban planning.
- I have a well-trained dog and several bicycles.
- I can be neurotic and will pull on a thread for longer than I probably should.
- This year I’m challenging myself to explore my creativity.
- I live in New York City with Spencer and Brian. One walks on two legs, the other on four.

I try to pay it forward; feel free to reach out.
