### Hi, I'm Peter.
I'm an inquisitive guy with varied interests. 

I was trained in financial analysis and have spent the last 12 years working in product at startups, growth-stage companies and enterprises. My professional expertise spans systems thinking and organizational design; ad tech and quantitative marketing; and "AI" including both classical ML and NLP techniques from the 2010s as well as contemporary approaches that use LLMs.

I'm passionate about Burning Man, PLUR rave culture, and urban planning. 

I have a well-trained dog and several bicycles.

I can be neurotic and will pull on a thread for longer than I probably should.

This year I’m challenging myself to explore my creativity.

I live in New York City with Spencer and Brian. My husband walks on two legs, my dog on four. 

I try to pay it forward; feel free to reach out.
